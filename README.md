# Zea Master Cylinder Showcase

Versatility is one of the key features of the Zea Engine. The master cylinder showcase demonstrates the flexibility of our SDK in four projects that show the same mechanical model being used for simulation, guided learning, parts identification and assembly.

Visit the [Zea showcase page](https://blog.zea.live/en/showcase/master-cylinder) for more information.

## Features

- Spring simulation
- Explode and cutaway views
- Identify parts with multilingual labels
- Change language on the fly
- Assemble parts with visual clues and snapping
- Simply change the URL to swap between each project

## Live Demos

- https://docs.zea.live/MasterCylinder?stage=simulation
- https://docs.zea.live/MasterCylinder?stage=learning
- https://docs.zea.live/MasterCylinder?stage=identification
- https://docs.zea.live/MasterCylinder?stage=assembly

### Specifying a Language

The engine will detect the language setting of your browser and display the labels for that language. However, to explicitly set the language, add the 'lang' argument to the URL. For example:

- https://docs.zea.live/MasterCylinder?stage=simulation&lang=Jp
- https://docs.zea.live/MasterCylinder?stage=learning&lang=Jp
- https://docs.zea.live/MasterCylinder?stage=identification&lang=Jp
- https://docs.zea.live/MasterCylinder?stage=assembly&lang=Jp

## Getting started

- Clone the repo
- Run `yarn install`
- Run a local server
